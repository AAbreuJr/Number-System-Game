## Motivation:
### When I first started to play with different bands, especially in the worship (CCM) genre, the Music Director (MD) would always call out numbers in different parts of songs. I had no clue what they were, so I had to learn what those numbers represented and engrave them in my head by reading and learning that way. I wish there were a game that helped with that. To help future musicians with this process, I decided to build this web browser game, "Number System Game."
 
## Prototype View:

# User Experience:
## User Persona #1:
### Mark works for a car rental company in Weymouth, MA.  One of his co-workers talks about the church he helps serves as the worship leader.  Mark would love to be able to join and help out with his musical talents. One problem he finds out once he goes to the first band rehearsal. He does not know what these numbers everyone keeps calling out are and how they translate into the music.  Mark wants to learn these numbers and what they mean in each key. Most importantly, to further his knowledge of music.  

## User Persona #2:
### Jim is an insane bass player and loves music.  He is one of the leading bass players at his local church and plays in cover bands all over the city.  Jim is getting tired of having to say the chords of sings instead of iterating numbers. He is looking for a way to repeatedly practice the number system so that he can give to his bandmates that do not know the number system to make playing every week so much easier.
